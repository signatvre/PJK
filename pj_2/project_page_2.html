          How is public transportation connected to climate change in our daily

          The function of passenger transport can be divided up into public and
          private transport. The latter of which is the most common method of
          transportation for people to use in Germany. Typically, private
          transportation means taking a car when and wherever you need to go.
          This comes with a big impact on the environment.

          Why is public transport more enviromentally friendly than individual
          transport?
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraph_p3_1">
          Three benefits of using Public Transport over individual Transport
          include the reduction of carbon emissions, air pollution and
          congestion on roads. Public transport brings these benefits to the
          table even though it may still rely on combustion engines, because
          more people can be transported using the same amount of space, which
          in turn reduces the amount of emissions produced to transport one
          person. Of our global emissions, 29% can be directly attributed to
          transport, which means that if society were to change commuting habits
          and increase its use of public transport, emissions can be reduced
          annually by 37 million tons according to the C2ES.

          What impact would changing to public transport for your daily commute
          have ?
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraph_p3_2">
          If you would take public transport to work instead of your own car,
          the German “Umwelt Bundesamt” suggests that you would save about
          3.700€ and about 320KG per year for a travel distance of 25 kilometers
          (Assumption: on 220 days, 25 km by suburban train and on foot instead
          of by car to work). In addition to saving a significant amount of
          money (especially taking into account the current fuel prices) you
          also get to utilise the time to work, read or to do anything you wish.

          Now seeing that public transport does have many advantages when
          looking at how environmentally friendly it is in comparison to cars,
          you can ask yourself why it is not the go to option for many people to
          travel from a to b.
