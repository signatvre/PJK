              Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and
              weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, but since the
              1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate
              change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels (like coal,
              oil and gas), which produces heat-trapping gases.</i

            Recently, this process has been accelerating and consequently
            endangering our environment and its ecosystems. Furthermore, a
            slight increase in temperatures globally leads to e. g. the melting
            of the polar caps and stark changes in weather patterns, such as an
            increase regarding hurricanes and floods – global warming is
            therefore not something that can be ignored any longer.

          Germany has taken a broad range of measures in order to reduce
          greenhouse gas emissions and therefore contain the development of
          climate change. So far, the implementation of the listed programmes
          and more has reduced Germany’s greenhouse gas emissions by about 40%
          since 1990.
