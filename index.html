              We are a group of students from the Albertus-Magnus Highschool in
              Germany. As part of our creative classes, we decided to create a
              website as a part of our research project. Since we are a part of
              Generation Z, the future of our environment not only plays a
              significant role in our lives generally, but it also affects our
              daily lives. Therefore, we made it our mission to find ways our
              everyday lives could be improved in order to fight global warming.

              One element that stays consistent regarding our daily lives is the
              use of public transport. However, this does not only apply to
              students – many people use public transport on a daily basis as a
              means of getting to work or travelling. As transport makes up to
              about 19% of Germany’s annual greenhouse gas emissions,
              transitioning this sector to a more climate-friendly and
              sustainable element would be of immense impact. In order to find
              ways to improve the transport sector’s emission balance, we have
              looked at the following aspects:
              <br />
              <br />
              &#x2022; The general connection of public transport to global
              warming
              <br />
              &#x2022; The current situation of transport systems in Germany
              <br />
              &#x2022; A case study
              <br />
              &#x2022; Changes that Germany could implement to reduce the
              transport sector’s emissions
