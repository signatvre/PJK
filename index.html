            We are a group of students from the Albertus-Magnus Highschool in
            Germany. As part of our creative classes, we decided to create a
            website as a part of our research project. Since we are a part of
            Generation Z, the future of our environment not only plays a
            significant role in our lives generally, but it also affects our
            daily lives. Therefore, we made it our mission to find ways our
            everyday lives could be improved in order to fight global warming.

            One element that stays consistent regarding our daily lives is the
            use of public transport. However, this does not only apply to
            students – many people use public transport on a daily basis as a
            means of getting to work or travelling. As transport makes up to
            about 19% of Germany’s annual greenhouse gas emissions,
            transitioning this sector to a more climate-friendly and sustainable
            element would be of immense impact. In order to find ways to improve
            the transport sector’s emission balance, we have looked at the
            following aspects:
