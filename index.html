        <h3 class="text_about">
          We are a group of students from the Albertus-Magnus Highschool in
          Germany. As part of our creative classes, we decided to create a
          website as a part of our research project. Since we are a part of
          Generation Z, the future of our environment not only plays a
          significant role in our lives generally, but it also affects our daily
          lives. Therefore, we made it our mission to find ways our everyday
          lives could be improved in order to fight global warming.

        <h3 class="text_project">
          One element that stays consistent regarding our daily lives is the use
          of public transport. However, this does not only apply to students –
          many people use public transport on a daily basis as a means of
          getting to work or travelling. As transport makes up to about 19% of
          Germany’s annual greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning this sector
          to a more climate-friendly and sustainable element would be of immense
          impact. In order to find ways to improve the transport sector’s
          emission balance, we have looked at the following aspects:
          <br />
          <br />
          The general connection of public transport to global warming, The
          current situation of transport systems in Germany , A case study and
          Changes that Germany could implement to reduce the transport sector’s
          emissions.
