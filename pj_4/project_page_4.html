          <h2>Sweden – the global role model of fighting climate change</h2>
          <div class="divider_2"></div>
          <p>
            With a share of 60.1% of renewable energies in 2020, Sweden is one
            of the most climate friendly countries in the world. For comparison,
            Germany’s share of renewable energies amounted to 16.4% in the same
            year. Furthermore, almost 50% of newly admitted cars in 2021 were
            electric cars. Meanwhile, the share of electric cars was only about
            17% in 2021 in Germany. Even though both countries are planning on
            achieving emission neutrality by 2045, Sweden seems to be closer to
            reaching said goal. But what is so different about Sweden?
            <br />
            <br />
            Generally speaking, there are four main differences regarding
            Sweden’s and Germany’s approaches to fighting climate change.

          <h2 class="heading_page_3">No.1: Nuclear Energy</h2>
          <p>
            Since the 1970s, Sweden has been employing nuclear reactors to
            produce electricity for commercial use. As of today, four nuclear
            power plants are still in use, producing about 30% of the country’s
            electricity. While they may produce radioactive waste, nuclear power
            plants produce no carbon emissions, making them a climate friendly
            and reliable source of energy. In Germany however, all 17 nuclear
            power stations had been shut off by the end of 2021 as a response to
            the Fukushima disaster of 2011. As a result, Germany still heavily
            relies on fossil fuels that emit high levels of CO2. While opinions
            may differ about the safety of nuclear reactors, their role as a
            low-carbon energy source cannot be questioned.

          <h2>No.2: Hydro Energy</h2>
          <p>
            In the Swedish electricity system, hydro power is currently Sweden's
            largest source of renewable energy and accounts for approximately
            45% of Swedish electricity generation. This is only possible due to
            Sweden’s naturally good availability of watercourses in forms of
            lakes and rivers. This is not possible in Germany as Germany simply
            does not have as good access to water as Sweden has. However, the
            German wind energy industry is steadily growing as its access to the
            Baltic Sea and especially the north of Germany make great options
            for reliable wind farms.

        <h2 class="heading_page_4">No.3: Carbon Tax</h2>
        <p>
          As one of the first countries in the world, Sweden introduced a carbon
          tax in 1991. Ever since, the price per ton of CO2 has risen from about
          30€ in 1991 to approximately 120€ in 2021. Additionally, the taxes on
          fossil motor fuels and oil for heating are especially high in Sweden,
          encouraging households to switch to cars and heating powered by
          electricity. While Germany also taxes fossil motor fuels and oil for
          heating, the carbon tax was only introduced in 2021 with a current
          price of 25€ per ton. Therefore, there is a lot more financial
          pressure on Swedish companies to start using more green energy in
          order to avoid high taxes. As a result, Sweden’s carbon emissions have
          decreased by over 40% since 1990.

        <h2>No.4: The Swedish Public Transport System</h2>
        <p>
          Due to its high share of renewable energies, many public transport
          systems in Sweden are powered by green energy. However, this is not
          the only thing that makes the Swedish public transport system
          different from Germany’s public transport system. While only about 14%
          of the German population use public transport frequently, this number
          is doubled when it comes to Sweden. So, what makes the Swedish public
          transport system so attractive?

          Taking a closer look at the Swedish Transport System – Stockholm
          County
        </h2>
        <p>
          Stockholm County is the area around and including Stockholm, the
          capital and largest city of Sweden with an approximate of 980.000
          inhabitants. With its more than two million inhabitants, Stockholm
          County is the most densely populated county in Sweden and the largest
          urban area in Scandinavia. Consequently, a reliable and effective
          public transport system is of extreme importance.

        <div class="divider_2"></div>
        <h2>Key Traits of the Stockholm Public Transport (SL)</h2>
        <p>
          - Variety: Stockholm Metro (Tunnelbana), commuter trains, light rail
          and even driverless busses
          <br />- Simplicity: all SL services use the same integrated ticket
          system <br />- Online Accessibility: the SL website contains all
          ticket and transport information as well as a journey planner <br />-
          Availability:
          <br />
          <br />
          &#x2022; The Stockholm Metro runs from 05:00 to 01:00 on weekdays, as
          well as being replaced by night busses from 01:00 to 05:00
          <br />
          &#x2022; Trains run around the clock on weekends
          <br />
          &#x2022; Busses serve all areas the metro does not reach: they operate
          every 3-10 minutes in the city and every 7-20 minutes in the less
          populated areas
          <br />
          <br />
          - Modernity: the Stockholm Metro is known for its outstanding visual
          art at stations and trains, making travelling by train a safer and
          more comfortable experience

        <h2>Conclusion of the Case Study</h2>
        <p>
          Sweden can serve as a role model to Germany not only in broader terms
          when it comes to climate protection, but especially when it comes
          improving the German public transport system. As Germany currently
          opposes the idea of reactivating its nuclear power stations, making
          its public transport system more attractive could be a first step
          towards emission neutrality.
          <br />
          As seen in the comparison with the Swedish transport system, some key
          aspects that would require improvement in Germany include a higher
          frequency, better online access and especially improvement of train
          and bus stations to ensure both passengers’ safety as well as simply a
          feeling of comfort and hygiene when taking the local public transport.
