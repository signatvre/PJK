          Avoiding traffic, saving time looking for a parking space and helping
          the environment – using public transportation has many advantages. Yet
          the car remains dominant, especially in Germany. In 2020 for example,
          the share of public transportation in motorized passenger transport
          was only 11%. That is below the EU average of 14% and far behind the
          leading countries Hungary and Austria with 23% and 26%.

        <h2>Why is public transport so rarely used ?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph_p2_1">
          According to the demographic portal of the federal and state
          governments, 70 million people live less than 600 meters from the next
          bus stop. However, that does not mean that public transportation is
          constantly available. It often means only one bus per hour. And that
          only between 7:00 and 17:00. Outside of these times and on the
          weekends, the situation gets much worse.
        </p>
        <div class="divider_2"></div>
        <p>
          Additionally, there is a huge difference between the cities and the
          rural areas. In sparsely populated counties, 40% of the people do not
          have access to decent public transportation. That leads to public
          transportation being responsible for a mere 5-7% of the total traffic.
          Hence, the majority depends on cars and currently, that does not seem
          to be about to change.

        <h2>Our mission – making public transport more attractive</h2>
        <p>
          We believe in the potential of public transportation. But at the same
          time, we know that the current system would need to be changed for it
          to become more attractive. In order to achieve that, we have come up
          with several ideas that could be realised in Germany.

            <b>Expansion of public transportation </b>
            <br />
            First of all, we propose an increase in the frequency of busses and
            trains – including evenings and weekends. We believe that public
            transportation has to meet the needs of the people. That is why the
            regular public transportation schedule should be complimented by
            special services, such as extra school trains.
          </p>
          <div class="divider_2"></div>
          <p>
            <b>Making public transportation modern and comfortable </b>
            <br />
            Many bus and train stops are old and run down. That needs to change
            with new and durable seats, roofings etc. There should also be
            possiblities to safely park your car or bicycle at your local train
            or bus stop. Furthermore, we think it is important to replace old
            train wagons and busses with new models. Since the world is becoming
            more and more digital, Wifi should be available in and around public
            transportation.

            <b>Ensuring the safety of passengers </b>
            <br />
            Especially late at night or during the dark winter months, many
            people are concerned about their safety at bus and train stops.
            These concerns have to be countered with an effective security
            concept. This should include visible cameras and lighting. We also
            believe that it is important to train drivers and other personell on
            how to react to different situations.

            <b>Accessibility for everyone </b>
            <br />
            If we want everyone to use public transportation, it has to be
            accessible for everyone as well. Especially handicapped persons,
            persons of age or parents with small children have to face a lot of
            challenges when using public transport. This could be improved by e.
            g. installing ramps and other aids for people with vehicles like
            wheelchairs or strollers. Essential information concerning departure
            times, schedules and cancellations have to be provided through
            various mediums, especially online.
